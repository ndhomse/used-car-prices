### Problem statement ###
To understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. Analyze and model the data (on 426k used cars) and provide clear recommendations to the client as to what consumers value in a used car.
Audience for this report is a group of used car dealers interested in fine-tuning their inventory.

#### Findings ####
* The car model, year and miles driven (odometer) are the biggest factors driving the price of a used car.
* Newer cars fetch higher price
* Lower miles on the car leads to higher price
* Car models are an important factor in determining the price of the car. For example, F-150, Silverado 1500, ram 1500 are priced well above the other models
* Car models data shows few inconsistencies in the data entered which results in perhaps diluting a particular model or mixing it up with different manufacturer models
* Cars manufactured by Ram and GMC are much higher priced than the other manufacturers
* Ford(60k), Chevrolet(46k), Toyota(30k) have the max number of cars in the data analyzed
* And, the F-150(7k), Silverado 1500(4.4k) and Ram 1500(3.8k) have the highest number of models
* Over 98% of the cars have clean/other title
* Less than 7% cars have manual transmission, majority are automatic transmission
* Majority of cars use gas fuel. Less than 10% of the cars use diesel fuel or are hybrid/electric


#### Next Steps and Recommendations ####
* It would be beneficial to focus on acquiring and listing newer models with lower odometer readings. Likely to have better prices and higher demand
* Models F-150, Silverado 1500, ram 1500 should be preferred as they have good volume and likely to have better demand and sales prices which should result in better margins
* Among manufacturers, it would be better to focus on Ram and GMC
* It would be worthwhile to clean up the data, especially for model and manufacturer. It will help create better pricing models with higher accuracy and enable the dealer to price the cars closer to the real value and generate better / quicker sales
